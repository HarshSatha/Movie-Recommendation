# Movie-Recommendation

Introduction:
The Movie Recommendation System is a tool that predicts and suggests movies to users based on their historical preferences and ratings. It leverages collaborative filtering, a popular recommendation technique, to analyse user behaviour and provide personalized movie recommendations. The system is implemented in Python and demonstrates the fundamental concepts of data pre-processing, similarity calculation, and recommendation generations.

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to develop a functional movie recommendation system that:
1.	Recommends movies to users based on their preferences.
2.	Uses collaborative filtering techniques for effective prediction.
3.	Provides a user-friendly way to display recommendations.
